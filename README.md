# V.E.N.T.R.I.S

> **Virtual Environment for Neural Tracking, Recognition, and Intelligent System**

**V.E.N.T.R.I.S** is an Iron Man-inspired air-gesture control system that turns your webcam into a futuristic human-computer interface. It lets you:

- **Move your cursor** by waving your finger in the air
- **Click, double-click, right-click, and drag** using hand gestures
- **Launch apps instantly** by showing a specific number of fingers
- **Copy, paste, undo, and perform text operations** hands-free
- **Control media playback, volume, and system shortcuts** without touching your keyboard or mouse

No special hardware required—just your webcam and your hands.
